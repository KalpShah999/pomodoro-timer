# pomodoro-timer
A simplistic web application for a Pomodoro productivity timer.


I always find myself using pomodoro apps in order to stay focused and improve my productivity.
However, with most applications nowaways, the app itself is why I lose focus.
This app has been designed to be the most barebones self operating pomodoro timer in order to not disturb me while working.


This web app was created using React and Javascript. 
This project helped me learn more about traversing through various components in React while maintaining data.


In order to run the application yourself (since a web domain has not been purchased for this application), open the "pomodoro-timer" directory in the terminal or command prompt. 
  "./pomodoro-timer"
In the directory, with npx and react installed, run the following command (without quotation marks) to get the local server running:
  "npm start"
